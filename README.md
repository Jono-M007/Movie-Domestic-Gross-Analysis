# Movie-Domestic-Gross-Analysis
This repository contains an analysis of domestic and international gross percentages for various films, performed using R. The goal of this project was to recreate a previously lost visualization that highlighted trends in movie gross distribution based on domestic vs. international performance.

## Project Overview
The movie reviews website requested an analysis that would visually represent the domestic gross percentages across different films. The task was to write the R code that would recreate the original chart as closely as possible to the one provided. This analysis provides insights into the financial success of movies in their local and international markets.

## Key Insights:
1.High Domestic Gross: Films with stronger domestic gross percentages often show strong local market appeal, potentially driven by cultural relevance, star power, or targeted marketing.

2.Low Domestic Gross: Films with a lower domestic percentage often perform better internationally, indicating broader global appeal or weaker performance in their home market.

## Takeaways
Understanding the balance between domestic and international grosses is critical for making informed decisions in movie production, marketing, and distribution. Identifying patterns in movie performance can help studios better target specific markets and maximize their revenue potential.

## Conclusion
This analysis allows for a deeper understanding of how films perform in the domestic market compared to international markets, offering insights into movie production and distribution strategies.
